# Intro - Power Apps Canvas Apps

Power Apps Canvas Apps is a low-code platform that allows you to build custom business applications without the need for extensive coding knowledge. Canvas Apps are designed to run on various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and web browsers.

=== "C"

    ``` c { .yaml .copy }
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      printf("Hello world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
    ```

=== "C++"

    ``` c++
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void) {
      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
    ```

## Getting Started

1. **Sign in to Power Apps:** Visit [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) and sign in with your Microsoft account or organizational credentials.

2. **Create a new app:** Click on the "Create" button and select "Canvas app from blank."

3. **Design your app:** The Canvas App designer provides a visual interface where you can drag and drop controls, such as buttons, text boxes, and galleries, onto the canvas. You can also connect your app to various data sources, such as Excel files, SharePoint lists, or custom connectors.

## Key Features

### Data Sources

Power Apps Canvas Apps support a wide range of data sources, including:

- Excel files
- SharePoint lists
- Microsoft Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service)
- SQL Server databases
- Azure SQL databases
- and many more through connectors

### Controls

Canvas Apps provide a rich set of controls that you can use to build your user interface, such as:

- Text input controls (text boxes, date pickers, etc.)
- Galleries (to display lists of data)
- Charts and graphs
- Media controls (for images, videos, etc.)
- Custom controls (build your own reusable components)

### Formulas and Logic

Power Apps uses a formula language similar to Excel, allowing you to define calculations, data transformations, and app logic without writing code. You can use formulas to perform operations on data, validate user input, and control the flow of your app.

### Integration and Connectors

Canvas Apps can integrate with a variety of services and systems through connectors. Connectors allow you to connect your app to external data sources, APIs, and services, enabling you to build powerful and connected applications.
